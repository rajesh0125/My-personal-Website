            <p>My name is <strong>Rajesh Gupta</strong>, and I am from the serene town of <strong>Shoratgrah ,Siddharthnagar (Uttar Pradesh)</strong>. Growing up in a close-knit community has instilled in me strong values of cooperation and respect. I completed my +2 education at Butwal, at Tillotama Higher Secondary School, where I am not only focused on academics but also developed a passion for extracurricular activities.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am pursuing my BTech degree at Maharishi Markandeshwar (Deemed to be University) in Mullana, Ambala. My journey in higher education has been both challenging and rewarding. I have immersed myself in various technical subjects, enhancing my knowledge in areas such as programming, cyber security and software development. This academic pursuit has ignited a passion for technology and innovation, inspiring me to continuously seek knowledge and improve my skills.</p>

            <p>Outside of academics, I have taken part in various workshops and seminars that have allowed me to gain practical experience in coding and project management. These experiences have not only broadened my technical skills but have also taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.</p>
